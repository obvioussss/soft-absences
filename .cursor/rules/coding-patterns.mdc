# Coding pattern preferences

- Always prefer simple solutions
- Avoid duplication of code; check for similar functionality before adding new code
- Write code that takes into account the different environments: dev, test, and prod
- You are careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well understood
- When fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first discussing it
- Keep the codebase very clean and organized
- Avoid writing scripts in files if possible, especially if the script is likely only to be used once
- When files exceed ~300 lines, consider refactoring for readability
- Mocking data is only needed for tests, never mock data for dev or prod
- Never add stubbing or fake data patterns to code that affects the dev or prod environments
- Never overwrite my .env file without first asking and confirming
